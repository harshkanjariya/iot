      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 3 October 2024</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how AutoHome ("we," "us," or "our") protects your privacy when using our app
        ("App"), <strong>Smart Home (Remote)</strong>, and hardware products ("Hardware") to control home appliances. By
        using the App and Hardware, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
      <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personal data through the App. The App communicates directly with your
        connected hardware devices over your local network. All data and commands remain within your local network, and
        no information is sent to our servers or third-party services.</p>
      <h2>2. Local Network Communication</h2>
      <p>The App operates solely within your local network (e.g., Wi-Fi). All communication between the App and the
        Hardware is confined to this network, and no data is transmitted to external servers or third parties.</p>
      <h2>3. Security</h2>
      <p>Although we do not collect any personal data, we recommend that you secure your local network to prevent
        unauthorized access to your connected hardware devices. Ensure your Wi-Fi network uses a strong password and
        appropriate encryption (e.g., WPA2) to safeguard your devices and communications.</p>
      <h2>4. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
      <p>Our App is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any personal data,
        we do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>
      <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will update the "Effective Date"
        at the top of the policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any changes.</p>
